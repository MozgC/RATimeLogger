Short description
=============
This is a tiny program to log what you do at your computer. Your activity is saved to a plain text file. 
Currently the program shows a popup window every 10 minutes asking for your activity. 
You can quickly select one from a predefined list or you can enter custom activity. You can just close the popup window and nothing will be saved to the log. 
You can also disallow closing the window to force you enter your activity - this adds some pressure when you are entering something like "chatting" at the time 
you must be working.
